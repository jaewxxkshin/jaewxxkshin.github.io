# OPIC 포스팅은 한 콤보에 해당하는 3가지 질문과 각 질문에 대한 필자의 대답으로 진행됩니다.
## You indicated that you're a student. What is your major? Why did you choose that specific major? What do you learn in your classes?
I'm currently majoring in mechanical engineering.  
The reason why I chose mechanical engineering as my major is that I was curious about how machines work.  
So I read up on all things related to my major like static, dynamic, aerodynamic, thermodynamics.  
You know I'm satisfied with my current major, but I'm also interested in artificial intelligence.
So I chose computer science as my minor.  
before I took minor classes, I have no idea all things that related to computer programming.  
It was tough at first, I stuck with it.  
As a result of studying both hard, I came down to robotics that connects mechanical engineering and computer engineering.  
So I came to decision that being a robotics engineer.  
I believe that a solid background in mechanical engineering and computer programming are helpful for being a robotics engineer.
Therefore, I think that I chose the major and minor well.  

## You mentioned in the background survey that you're a student. Which classes are you taking this semester? What are they about? Please focus on one or two, and describe them in detail.  
Since I'm currently on summer vacation, I'll tell you about last semester.  
I took four classes last semester and I'd like to describe the one that I spend most time.
the name of class is 'Capstone Design'.  
I must take this class to graduate.  
This is a course that make a graduation work and present it.  
To make a graduation work, have to work as a team.  
So it is important to find a team members who have the same goal.  
In my case As I decide to make a self-driving car as a graduation work.  
So I looked for team members who interested in self-driving car and made up team of four members.
As a result of working as a team, We succeeded self-driving car simulation.  
We will be continuing the class next semester as a name of 'Capstone Design2'.  
at the end of class I hope that we can make a self-driving car, not a simulation  

## Tell me about the most difficult test you've taken in school. What in particular made the test difficult? How did you study for it? What was the result of the test?
